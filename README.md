# Real-Time Drosophila Detection App

Welcome to the **Real-Time Drosophila Detection App**! This application leverages the power of **Detectron2** and **Streamlit** to provide real-time detection of male and female Drosophila (fruit flies) using your webcam or captured images.



---

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-Time Detection:** Utilize your webcam to detect and visualize male and female Drosophila in real-time.
- **Image Capture:** Capture images and run detections on static photos.
- **Interactive Interface:** Easily switch between live video and image capture modes using a user-friendly sidebar.
- **Confidence Threshold Adjustment:** Dynamically adjust the confidence threshold to filter detections.
- **Visual Feedback:** View bounding boxes and labels for detected instances directly on the video feed or images.
- **Git Large File Storage (LFS):** Efficiently manage and store large model files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the application on your local machine.

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jayantrai12/important.git
cd important
```

### **2. Set Up Git Large File Storage (LFS)**

Ensure that Git LFS is installed to manage the large model file.

#### **Install Git LFS**

- **macOS:**

  ```bash
  brew install git-lfs
  ```

- **Ubuntu/Debian:**

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install git-lfs
  ```

- **Windows:**

  Download and run the installer from [Git LFS Releases](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases).

#### **Initialize Git LFS**

```bash
git lfs install
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

#### **Using `venv`:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### **Install Required Packages:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, create one with the following content:

```text
streamlit
opencv-python
numpy
torch
torchvision
torchaudio
av
pillow
detectron2
streamlit-webrtc
```

**Important:** Installing **Detectron2** may require additional steps based on your system and CUDA version. Refer to the [Detectron2 Installation Guide](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/install.html) for detailed instructions.

### **4. Verify Model File**

Ensure that the model file `model_final_f10217.pkl` is present in the repository and tracked by Git LFS.

```bash
git lfs ls-files
```

You should see an entry like:

```
9a737e2903 * model_final_f10217.pkl
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Run the Streamlit app using the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### **App Interface**

1. **Select Input Method:**
   - **Live Video:** Use your webcam for real-time detection.
   - **Capture Image:** Take a snapshot and run detections on the captured image.

2. **Live Video Mode:**
   - Grant camera access when prompted by your browser.
   - Adjust the **Confidence Threshold** slider in the sidebar to filter detections based on confidence scores.
   - View real-time detections with bounding boxes and labels for male and female Drosophila.

3. **Capture Image Mode:**
   - Click on **"Take a picture"** to capture an image using your webcam.
   - The app will process the image and display detected instances with bounding boxes and labels.
   - View the number of detected instances and their respective classes and confidence scores.

### **Example Commands**

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
```
